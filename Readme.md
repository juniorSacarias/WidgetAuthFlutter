## üìñ Introduction

Flutter Auth Widget is a project that implements a clean architecture for an authentication system in Flutter. This project is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and customizable, and provides a structured solution for managing authentication in Flutter applications.

The project organizes the code into clear layers, separating business logic, user interface, and infrastructure.

It started as a learning project but I leave it available and free to use for anyone interested.
